# ---  Release Notes for Carla 1.0.0  ---

1.  ZynAddSubFX internal plugin is not available in the pre-compiled builds.
    We'll try to enable it in a future release.

2.  Canvas does not save or restore connections.
    You need to use external session management for now.

3.  LADISH does not support multi-client JACK applications.
    To prevent any issues Carla will switch to single-client mode automatically.

4.  Rack mode is still a bit experimental, specially on non-JACK drivers.

5.  LV2 plugin support is incomplete (although already in a good state).
    Plugins that use CV ports or Worker extension will not work right now.

6.  Carla will not work with non-native LV2 Plugin UIs that require the instance-data extension.
    This is by design and not a bug.

6.  OSC control seems to work well, but has not been tested in great detail.
    Be sure to report any issues.

7.  Carla "PRO" theme and Carla-Control are not available for Windows at this point.
