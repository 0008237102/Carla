# ---  Release Notes for Carla 1.2.x  ---

1.  Canvas does not save or restore connections.
    You need to use external session management for now.

2.  LADISH does not support multi-client JACK applications.
    To prevent any issues Carla will switch to single-client mode automatically.

3.  Rack mode is still a bit experimental, specially on non-JACK drivers.

4.  LV2 plugin support is incomplete (although already in a good state).
    Plugins that use CV ports or Worker extension will not work right now.

5.  Carla will not work with non-native LV2 Plugin UIs that require the instance-data extension.
    This is by design and not a bug.

6.  OSC control seems to work well, but has not been tested in great detail.
    Be sure to report any issues.

7.  Carla "PRO" theme, Carla-Control and ZynAddSubFX internal plugin are not available for Windows at this point.
